PyDM
----

An excellent way to learn PyDM is to go through and explore the `self-paced tutorial <https://slaclab.github.io/pydm-tutorial/>`_
which covers from the basics of making displays using the Qt Designer up to intelligent
displays developed using the Qt Designer for layout and Python for data processing code.

Another very useful resource and in constant improvement is the `PyDM documentation <https://slaclab.github.io/pydm/>`_
which covers more aspects of PyDM for users and developers.
